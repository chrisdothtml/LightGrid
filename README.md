LightGrid
===
Powerful, lightweight responsive grid

### Demo

You can view a Demo of LightGrid [here](http://codepen.io/chrisdothtml/pen/razGKG).

### Why should I use LightGrid?

While there are plenty of pre-packaged responsive libraries out there, LightGrid trims the fat, and only gives you the bare essentials for responsive development; so you can quickly dive into a project, and focus on the the important stuff.

### How do I get started?

To use LightGrid, all you need is to download the .css or .min.css files. If you'd like to edit LightGrid, download or clone the entire repo, and run the following:

	npm install

This will install Grunt and all the dependencies necessary for the project.
