LightGrid
===
Powerful, lightweight responsive grid

### Why should I use LightGrid?

While there are plenty of pre-packaged responsive libraries out there, LightGrid trims the fat, and only gives you the bare essentials for responsive development; so you can quickly dive into a project, and focus on the the important stuff.

### How do I get started?

1. Download the files
2. Either add the Scss to your project, or call the compiled Css in your Html
3. There is no Step 3; you're done.
